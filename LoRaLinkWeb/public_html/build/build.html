        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            You need a T-Beam and a SD-Card or an ESP32 with GPS RX Module and a SD-Card.<br/>
            <br/>
            You can solder the SD-Adapter directly to the ESP or T-Beam to get rid of the SD-Shield (take care of wiring):<br/>
            <br/>

        <p>
            The project was written with the Arduino IDE, so you need to install the Arduino IDE and the ESP-Toolchain.<br/>
            After Installation install the following libraries:<br/>
            <br/>
            - NTPClient 3.2.1<br/>
            - SD 1.2.4<br/>
            - Adafruit SSD1306 2.5.7<br/>
            - ArduinoJson 6.19.4<br/>
            - Bounce2 2.71.0<br/>
            - DS3231 1.1.0<br/>
            - TinyGPS 13.0.0<br/>
            - EasyDDNS 1.8.0<br/>
            <br/>
            Libs from Github:<br/>
            <br/>
            - https://github.com/StuartsProjects/SX12XX-LoRa <br/>
            - https://github.com/trlink/WSFFileDB <br/>
            - https://github.com/trlink/ESP32_HTTPS_Server <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After installation take the SD-Card and copy the content of the Web-Application in the root directory 
            of the SD-Card. This makes the life easier, when you solder the SD-Card (or the Micro SD adapter) 
            directly to the ESP)... <br/>
            <br/>
            The Pins are defined in the file HardwareConfig for the 3 supported microcontrollers:<br/>
            <br/>
            - T-Beam<br/>
            - Heltec ESP32<br/>
            - Liligo LoRa devices<br/>
            <br/>
            Even if supported, do not use SPIFFS, since I run into problems storing and modifying the data on the FS...<br/>
            LittleFS has problems when it is called from different threads (which I do)...<br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h1>Compile & Flash</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Go to the file HardwareConfig.h and set the options acording to your device. There are enough comments in it.<br/>
            <br/>
            Compile & flash the ESP, the compilation will take some time, after the device was flashed, the hard task is finished...<br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h1>Configuration / Quick Setup</h1>
        <br/>
        After the ESP is booted, it will create an open access point, connect to it and browse to: http://192.168.5.1/administration.html <br/>
        The default user is admin with an empty password, you should change it asap...<br/>
        After the data was loaded, select "Settings" in the left panel and set the Device Node ID to something which is not in use and not 0!<br/>
        Give the device a name under "Device Name" (don't use blanks or special chars).<br/>
        You can play later with this settings...<br/>
        <br/>
        Switch to the Tab "LoRa TRX Settings":<br/>
        <br/>
        Set the Frequency to something according to your countrys regulations and the 
        used ESP (doesn't make sense to set a 70cm frequency on a 800Mhz LoRa variant)...<br/>
        Remove the checkmark from "Disable LoRa Modem".<br/>
        Leave the other settings untouched, otherwise you know, what to set...<br/>
        <br/>
        Select the "Device" Tab on the left panel and click on "Reset Device".<br/>
        If you have a network in reach, the device should connect automatically.<br/>
